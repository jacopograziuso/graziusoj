Hello, my name is Jacopo Graziuso. I am a trainee economist with a degree in Economics and Finance, and I am currently enrolled on a Master's degree in Econometrics.
I specialise in economic and financial dissemination, particularly on the subject of Bitcoin, treating it not only as a monetary phenomenon, but also as a cultural, social and political one.
As a VAT-registered teacher and trainer, I deliver professional training courses on cross-disciplinary subjects such as accounting, finance, marketing and technology throughout Italy.
I am also involved in the Salento Bitcoin project, a free and independent dissemination initiative.
I write and create digital content, participate in podcasts, and actively contribute to public debates on the future of money.
On Medium, I publish reflections, analyses and articles related to my studies, research and dissemination work.
I believe in the power of shared knowledge and the importance of making complexity understandable.
